# PopCalc
A simple browser-based calculator based on views, bookmarks and age.


HOW TO USE:

1: Input a name to identify your character (Doesn't actually affect anything)

2: Input view count, age of the profile and number of Bookmarks

3: Press 'Input', an alert pop-up will come up with the input name, views-per-day and bookmark-to-viewer percentage.

4: After you close this alert, you will get an error 405 message. This is normal, simply hit f5/refresh to use it again.
