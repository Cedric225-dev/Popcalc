# PopCalc
A simple browser-based calculator based on views, bookmarks and age.


TODO:

1: Get data entry working, have a dynamic text block confirm to the user their entries, listing the names of input data sets.

2: Set it up so that the user may input the form multiple times. Each time they input, add to a growing array of the value sets.

3: Once the hits some sort of 'display' button, run the math and output a list of the input names and intended calculations.

4: Make this look like not shit

5: Basic input validation
