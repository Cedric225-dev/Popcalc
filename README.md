# PopCalc
A simple browser-based calculator based on views, bookmarks and age.


HOW TO USE:

1: Input a name to identify your character (Doesn't actually affect anything)

2: Input view count, age of the profile and number of Bookmarks

3: Press 'Input', an alert pop-up will come up with the input name, views-per-day and bookmark-to-viewer percentage.

4: After you close this alert, you will get an error 405 message. This is normal, simply hit f5/refresh to use it again.

PLANS FOR UPDATES:

The downloadable branch is an attempt to make a more functional version of the calculator that users will need to download locally.
Using HTML and Javascript means that no special program will be needed to run the code, but this is the only solution that will be free and anonymous.

Users are still encouraged to browse the code in the github repo, if they are concerned that this calculator is doing more than it seems.
